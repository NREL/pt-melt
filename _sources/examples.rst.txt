Example Notebooks
=================

The examples folder includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use
of the ``PT-MELT`` package for different machine learning tasks. The examples included
are:

- **Regression (regression.ipynb)**: This notebook demonstrates how to use the
  ``PT-MELT`` package for regression tasks. The notebook uses each of the models
  available in ``PT-MELT`` and showcases the use of uncertainty quantification for each
  of the model types. The notebook demonstrates the entire typical workflow for ML
  regression:

    - Data creation
    - Data preprocessing
    - Model creation
    - Model training
    - Model evaluation
    - Visualizing model results
